# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# Challenge Goals 
## Making Commits everyday throught the whole 100 days

### Day 1: 10/1/2020
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
The Goal of today was to get CSS grid down. I feel rather comfortable with HTML and very basic CSS, my biggest struggle, and the things I know will be the most instrumental in my Front End toolkit is ... Grid and Flexbox. I started off the day with CSSGRID.io which was a free crash course in grid featuring 4 hours of videos of instruction. I fell asleep after about 40 mins of videos. But that is no fault of the videos. I moved on to code academy for the remainder of CSS Grid and closed out the day with making some Quizlet cards for Grid ad praciting some grids.
**Thoughts:** 
Today I learned that my learning style is for sure NOT just listening to lecture videos. I disengage very quickly. I work much better when I am doing something hands on.
