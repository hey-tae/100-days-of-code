# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# Challenge Goals 
## Making Commits everyday throught the whole 100 days

### Day 1: 10/1/2020
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 
The Goal of today was to get CSS grid down. I feel rather comfortable with HTML and very basic CSS, my biggest struggle, and the things I know will be the most instrumental in my Front End toolkit is ... Grid and Flexbox. I started off the day with CSSGRID.io which was a free crash course in grid featuring 4 hours of videos of instruction. I fell asleep after about 40 mins of videos. But that is no fault of the videos. I moved on to code academy for the remainder of CSS Grid and closed out the day with making some Quizlet cards for Grid ad praciting some grids.

**Thoughts:** 
Today I learned that my learning style is for sure NOT just listening to lecture videos. I disengage very quickly. I work much better when I am doing something hands on.

### Day 2 
#####

**Today's Progress**: 
Today was a very long day yet also felt very short. I woke up tired and it lasted all day. I had planned to start my flexbox class today but I knew that the second I turned the videos on, I would knock right out. So I decided to take things a little lighter today. I made some cards on Quizlet and sent in a video application to a 30 week full stack bootcamp. I also had a final round job interview, not tech related but the hours would set me up much better to participate in the bootcamp if I got in.

Last night I was trying to add a new project to github and was having the HARDEST time getting it done, and I am not sure why since I followed all of the steps. But I am going to look into it more for day 3. I also am planning to leave my resources up on my laptop so i had no destractions tomorrow 

**Thoughts**: 
I think that working out in the morning made a big difference yesterday. I had a lot more energy going in to the day, I could have also been riding the high of it being the first of the month and start of this challenge.

### Day 3 

**Today's Progress**: 
Today I woke up at 7 to start coding, and by 7:34 I was back in bed. But I tried! It's saturday, I don't HAVE to wake up early to get my daughter to daycare or anything like that. So I took advantage. I took the opportunity to sleep for a couple more hours to recharge so I could put in a full days work. 
<br>

On the agenda for the day was starting Wes Bos Flexbox program, and start some of his code alongs. I planned for that to take much of the day. To my (not) surprise, the whole lecture thing again did not work for me. I read someone last weekend that "learning styles" were a myth and that you should try a bunch of different ones before you find what works for you. And still continue to switch it up every now and then. Well I have tried the lecture thing many times and I can't NOT fall asleep while someone is talking at me. So that plan got axed. 
<br>

Since it was the only thing on the agenda I had to go to my forever back up plan. [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). Which I should probably bring to the forefront since it's usually where I end up. I redid the flexbox section of the responsive design CSS module. This go around on fCC, I am going through each section and making flash cards which I go over during my weekday morning commutes. Once I had the cards done I decided I would tackle some of the projects that I have been avoiding. I started with the tribute page and it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be (with my new found understanding of CSS)
